# Project 2: Screens in Space - 20% 
#### Due Week 8. This project can be done individually or as a pair. 

## Overview 
Create a site-specific installation using your computer screen and p5.js. Think about how people in these spaces interact and expect screens to behave in different contexts. Your piece does not have to be interactive, but it does have to evolve or change over time in some way. This can exist anywhere, but you should be able to show us the work either through video documentation and demo in class or, take us to the piece physically for critique. You can do this project in pairs or individually, but no bigger groups. You can use a makeymakey to simualte keybaord input
