Create a piece of code that uses a function to draw targets on the screen using a for loop when the mouse is clicked at the mouse position. The targets should alternate between two colours that are randomly selected with each new target.

Use a different function to return a value to check the mouse position. If the mouse position in in the upper right or lower left, add a circle to the next target drawn. If the position is in the lower right or upper left, remove a circle in the next target drawn
