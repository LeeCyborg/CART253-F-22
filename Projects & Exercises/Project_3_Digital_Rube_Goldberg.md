# Proejct 3: Digital Rube Goldberg - 40% 
A Rube Goldberg machine uses one element to trigger another. Usually they are physical, but we will make a software version! Heres an example of a physical Rube Goldberg machine.

The goal of this project is to pass along a variable between programs to create a chain. Every person will get a number from someone else, use this number to create a piece of generative art, then pass along a new number to the next person. You must use MQTT to pass a variable.

Your piece can be ANYTHING: Audio, Visual, interactive, it can use a camera, it can use external data, particle systems, drawing, physical interactions, etc. Your work should be complex and show the skills we learned throughout the semester and things youâ€™ve explored on your own. 
Your project must:
- Use MQTT protocol to send/receive messages
- Receive a variable from another person
- Use the variable as a factor in creating a visual, auditory, and/or interactive work.
- Change the variable in some way
- Send the variable successfully to the next person
- Successfully complete this task during critique 

Grading criteria:
- Successfully receiving / changing / using / sending your variables
- Using 1 external library for p5js in a meaningful capacity
- Creativity and application
- Complexity of code
