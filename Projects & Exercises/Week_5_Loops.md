Create a program that:   
- Draws a checkerboard (alternating square of color) every time the mouse is pressed with a different color scheme and different checker size each time.
   Hints: Use a nested for loop to make the squares. Use Modulo to check for every second one. Use the mousePressed() function. Create variables for size.
