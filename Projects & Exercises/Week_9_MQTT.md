Set up an MQTT template that sends and receives data from either another browser window or someone else in the class from the CART253 topic using the template provided.   When you click anywhere on the canvas, your program should send an MQTT message to someone else that draws a target in the same X and Y position on their canvas as sender clicked. Your program should be able to receive clicks and draw targets as well.   Your targets should be randomly generated color, size, and number of circles (see last assignment).  When you receive a message, draw a green circle on the bottom left IF its for you, draw a red circle if it ISN”T for you. Draw a blue circle on the right when you send a message.
