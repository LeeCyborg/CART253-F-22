# Project 1: Portrait - 10 %
### Due Week 3, bring your work to class ready to critique. Uplaod to Moodle by midnight     
## Overview 
With p5.js, create a portrait of someone - yourself, your pet, a partner, friend of family member using shape functions. Don't try and be fancy with your code, instead focus on creating a clean, creative, and beautiful piece you understand using basic functions.   

## Requirements 
- Use multiple functions from the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)     
-- 2D primatives such as arc(), ellipse(), circle(), line(), point(), quad(), rect(), square(), triangle()    
-- [Colors](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color)   
-- [background](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background)     
-- Bezier curves    
- Use at least 2 variables in your code

Check out [this](https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html) tutorial shapes and [this](https://p5js.org/learn/color.html) one on color for more information as well as notes from week 1 and 2. 

## Grading
- Functionality   
- Creativity   
- Code is commented clearly     

## Submission 
Upload your code in a zipped folder to Moodle by **midnight of the class** and come to class prepraed to share your work. After every unique line, comment your code and explain what it does. If you don't understand what your code is doing, don't hesitate toa ask!
// Use two slashes to comment a line of code.    
/* Comment a bigger section of code like this    
   You can comment multiple lines.   
   Make sure to reference anywhere you took code from here.*/.      
At the top of your code, add your NAME, DATE, and TITLE of your piece. You can also add personal information if you'd like. Its good practice to do this because you may share your code with others some day!
