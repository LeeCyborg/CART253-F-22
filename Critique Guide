If you’re presenting: 

What did you make? What inspired you or influenced you?
How does it work? What are some technical highlights ?
What do you like about it ? 
What do you feel like you could improve on? 
Do you feel like it was successful? What would you do next time? What did you learn? 


If you’re critiquing: 

What did you notice first ? 
Did your project use similar techniques or style? What did you learn by doing yours that the presenter might be interested in ? 
What do you feel like is successful or interesting? 
What doesn’t quite work? How would you fix it ? 
Is there a technical element you know how to fix? 
Are there style, aesthetic, or visual choices that might help the presenter be more successful? 


Remember to be critical and constructive! We are here to help each other improve!
